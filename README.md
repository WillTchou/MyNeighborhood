My Neighborhood is a project I've created to train myself. With my neightborhood, we can ask for help around you neighborhood.

Once you've created your account, you can ask for help. There's two types of resquests: One-time task (help somenone fix his car) and Material need (bring a wrench).

Another user can be a volunteer and fulfill your request by clicking on the button "Fulfill the need !". Then the volunteer can chat with the request.
